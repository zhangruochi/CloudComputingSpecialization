## Cloud Computing Specialization + CS199 Applied Cloud Computing


# Cloud Computing Specialization

**About this Specialization** The Cloud Computing Specialization takes you on a tour through cloud computing systems. We start in in the middle layer with Cloud Computing Concepts covering core distributed systems concepts used inside clouds, move to the upper layer of Cloud Applications and finally to the lower layer of Cloud Networking. We conclude with a project that allows you to apply the skills you've learned throughout the courses.


# Cloud Computing Concepts, Part 1

## About this Course

- Cloud computing systems today, whether open-source or used inside companies, are built using a common set of core techniques, algorithms, and design philosophies – all centered around distributed systems. Learn about such fundamental distributed computing "concepts" for cloud computing.
 
- Some of these concepts include: clouds, MapReduce, key-value/NoSQL stores, classical distributed algorithms, widely-used distributed algorithms, scalability, trending areas, and much, much more! 
 
- Know how these systems work from the inside out. Get your hands dirty using these concepts with provided homework exercises. In the programming assignments, implement some of these concepts in template code (programs) provided in the C++ programming language. Prior experience with C++ is required.
 
- The course also features interviews with leading researchers and managers, from both industry and academia.

# CS 199 Applied Cloud Computing

## Informal Course Description

Cloud computing is increasingly becoming an area of interest in the tech industry. In this course, we will introduce service-level technologies including Hadoop, Spark, distributed databases and more. We will also introduce students to the concepts IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), Cloud Functions, and containerization. This course will be hands-on and focussed on applications of cloud computing; students will be using a cluster to explore cloud based technologies.

After taking this course, students will be experienced with cloud computing platforms, and will have been introduced to the processes necessary to build scalable cloud applications.

## Formal Course Description

This course is an introduction into cloud computing. We define cloud computing as the usage of services or infrastructure from the internet (what we refer to as the “cloud”) instead of self-hosted solutions.

This course will address two levels of cloud computing: IaaS and PaaS. IaaS is short for infrastructure- as-a-service, meaning that we will talk about different cloud computing systems and platforms (like AWS or GCP). We will go in depth about what these different systems are and what differentiates them. We will also give students a chance to use these in practice to have a firmer, hands-on experience on what they do. We will also have a brief overview on virtualization.

The second type of cloud computing we will cover is PaaS, which is short for platform-as-a-service. These are managed-infrastructure solutions that are hosted remotely, which can be used through an interface like SSH.

Throughout the course, we will also cover various common cloud computing applications. Some of the technologies that we cover are Hadoop, Spark, Messaging Queues, and SQL/NoSQL stores. While we won’t go through this software in detail, students will use all of these technologies in real-world settings through assignments.

We hope that students will have an opportunity to learn and explore something that they could not do on a normal basis. We welcome ideas and suggestions about what to cover.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, we wish students to know

- A survey of popular cloud platforms.
- A variety of cloud software applications
- How to query SQL and NoSQL datastores
- How to use Spark and Hadoop to run batch data jobs
- How messaging queues and discovery services tie the cloud together

## Machine Problem (MP) Policy
Machine Problems make up the majority of the student work for CS199. As such, it is important that students stay on top of the MP work. We suggest that students start MPs early, and go to office hours if feel like they need help.

- All MPs will be released after lectures on Thursdays.
- All MPs will be due on the following Wednesday at 11:59pm.
- No late MPs will be accepted, unless a valid excuse is presented to the course staff.

Note: Many of the MP assignments will be run on the CS199 Nebula cluster. We do not guarantee 100% uptime of this cluster. Additionally, we notice that many students try to complete assignments right before the deadline, and this can lead to severely decreased cluster performance.

Course staff also reserves the right to monitor and manage student submitted jobs on the cluster. If your code takes too much time to execute, or too much computing resources, course staff may terminate these jobs
